            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.  JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to takei t in a bunch of different directions.  JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic congrol over them.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, the varaible holds a value.  All JavaScript variables must be identified with uniquenames.  These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="purptext">var x;</span></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured into it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="purptext">var x = 10;</span></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="purptext">true</span> or <span class="purptext">false;</span> null - <span class="purptext">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class=purptext>42</span> or <span class="purptext">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="purptext">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="purptext">[1, 'Coding', 2, "Dojo"]</span> and Object
                    <span class='purptext'>{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditionals that have been met.  You can use conditional statements i your code to accomplish this.  There are the following conditional statements: <span class="purptext">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="purptext">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; ,<span class="purptext">else</span> we execute this block of code;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times.  Imagine that you have to run a mile, well you could run around the track four times and then you stop.  That's a loop!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block.  When we call our function this will run that code block.  Think of it as a list of instructions.  As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up.  Done! We finished our instructions.  Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</p>
